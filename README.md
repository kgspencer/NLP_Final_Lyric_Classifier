With the popularization of online music streaming services and platforms, recent years have seen the growth in development of programs and algorithms surrounding song metadata, often for the purpose of demographic analysis or user convenience. Some examples of these programs include song recommendation systems, genre categorization, and user listening profile analysis. Many of these features depend on models that involve the classification of songs by their content and affective meaning: their emotion, mood, and attitude. Affective classification is a relatively new area of research for music, centered around approaches for analysis based on either metadata of a song or its lyrical content. The goal of this study was to explore the classification of songs by emotion using lyrical content, comparing two versions of a logistic regression model implemented with different features. The first model was trained using a small set of features solely from the dataset, while the second model employed emotion-based word lexicons to pull outside data into the classification process. Based on the results of the study, the addition of lexicon features improved model performance in every one of the metrics measured, although in some cases only by a small margin, and the overall performance of the models still had considerable room for improvement.

NOTE: two files for our dataset (mxm_dataset_train.txt, mxm_train.csv) are too big to be uploaded to github.
